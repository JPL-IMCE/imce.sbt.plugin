# IMCE Build & Release Workflows

The IMCE SBT plugin supports two different workflows:

1) Maven-based build & release workflow

This workflow is intended to ensure reproducible builds of Maven artifacts
published to a NexusPro repository according to the Open-Source Software Repository Hosting
publication requirements applicable for publishing to [Maven central](http://search.maven.org).

2) Local development build workflow

This workflow is intended to facilitate agile local development using powerful capabilities
from IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ) and build tools (e.g. SBT).
